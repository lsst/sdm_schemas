# Currently, there is no Felis key to mark columns as part of the "minimal"
# set, and the definition of the "minimal" set is still in flux and a subject
# of active experimentation.  For now, maintain it here as a separate file.
# In the future, this is expected to be included in the output from
# build_datalink_metadata.py, run during the build.
