  The ImSim Schema describes the Science Pipelines outputs for on Imsim simulated full-focal-plane LSSTCam data.
  It is used in the CI testing of the pipelines.
tables:
- name: Object
  description: The object table contains descriptions of the multi-epoch static astronomical
    objects, in particular their astrophysical properties as derived from analysis
    of the Sources that are associated with them. Note that fast moving objects are
    kept in the MovingObject tables. Note that less-frequently used columns are stored
    in a separate table called Object_Extra.
