  The HyperSuprimeCam (HSC) Schema describes the outputs of the latest data release production pipelines for
  HyperSuprimeCam.
  It is used in the CI testing of the pipelines.
tables:
- name: Object
  description: The Object table contains descriptions of the multi-epoch static astronomical
    objects, in particular their astrophysical properties as derived from analysis
    of the Sources that are associated with them. Note that fast moving objects are
    kept in the MovingObject tables. Note that less-frequently used columns are stored
    in a separate table called Object_Extra.
